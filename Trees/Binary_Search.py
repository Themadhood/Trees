"""
A binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure that has the
following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the
node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the
node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
